# 👋 Hey, I’m Albert

## 🚀 What I Do
- **At LexisNexis Risk Solutions**  
  I led UX for **Automated Crash & Incident Reporting**—a public safety solution now helping law enforcement nationwide.  
  *Translation: I design tools that matter in the real world, not just pretty screens.*  

- **Founder of A.I.dvocate**  
  Creating **AI-powered apps** for the **neurodiverse community**, because technology should *empower*, not exclude.  
  - 🎮 [Mirror Match](#): A game to help process and reflect emotions  
  - 🌍 [CommuniSense](#): Turning chaotic social data into situational awareness  
  - 🛡 [CommuniGuard](#): AI that detects risks before they spiral  

- **Avva Design Solutions**  
  My creative lab for exploring **UX, AI, AR, and future-forward design experiments**.

## 🧩 Why I Build
I believe UX isn’t just about usability—it’s about **human connection, inclusion, and integrity of design**.  
Whether it’s a police officer filing a crash report, or a neurodiverse kid learning emotions through play—my job is to make that interaction *intelligent, meaningful, and effortless*.

## 🛠 Tech Playground
- **UXOps + DevOps mashups** (Storybook, Figma, component libraries)  
- **AI prototyping** (games, AR overlays, “AI-infused shopping carts”)  
- **Creative edge projects** (abstract animations, AR neuro coaches, even Klingon music theory—don’t ask 👽)
